                <br>
                <p>China has the second-largest film market in the world, with some experts estimating that this growing industry will surpass the American market by 2018. Today, no matter where a film is produced, most movies are shot digitally. If you are considering a career in filmmaking, this program will introduce you to the essential skills needed for advanced study in college. This course will allow you to gain a thorough understanding of the technical aspects of this digital art form including lens usage, light metering techniques, blocking, and professional conventions. You will work in small production crews and share different responsibilities, learning about writing, producing, storyboarding, cinematography, audio recording, and editing. In addition, you will explore how to develop creative concepts and how to capture them digitally—from the first shoot to the final edit. Morning and afternoon sessions will provide hands-on instruction, which will conclude in a showcase screening of your final film. You will shoot outdoors at local venues in Shanghai, gaining valuable experience and a finished digital portfolio piece.
